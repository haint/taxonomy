[Z] /--/ [Ardeidae] /--/ [Heron / Egret / Bittern] /--/ [Diệc] /--/ [World: 63 species, SE Asia: 21 species; Vietnam: 19 species. Include herons, bitterns, boatbills, and egrets. Long-legged tall waders. Catch fish, frogs, crabs, insects... by stabbing them with long pointed bills. Body long, slim. Bills straight, cone-shaped. Wings long, broad and rounded. In flight: long & slender neck tucked back in an 'S', not extended as storks, ibises and cranes. Sexes alike or very similar. Call: loud croaks and squawks. Most breed in colonies in trees and feed in the open.<br><br>BITTERNS: 12 species (4 'Botaurus', 8 'Ixobrychus') of subfamily 'Botarinae', similar to herons in habits and habitat, although in general have shorter necks and legs. Plumage brown, yellow and black, variously striped and speckled. Solitary, inhabiting reedy and marshy places. At the approach of a potential predator, stand motionless with head up and neck vertical so that their brown-streaked plumage makes them almost indistinguishable from the surrounding reeds. Sluggish, and its flight slow and of short duration. When attacked, use both bill and claws for defense. Make a rude nest of sticks or reeds. 4-5 greenish-brown eggs. Diet: fish, frogs, crayfish, and other small swamp and marsh animals, speared by sharp-pointed bills. Occur almost worldwide.<br><br>EGRETS: various wading species, especially those having white plumage and bearing long, soft plumes on the lower parts of their backs during the breeding season. Some perform elaborate mating displays involving plumes. Typically frequent marshes, lakes, humid forests, and other wetland environments. Catch small fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and crustaceans in shallow waters. They build large, untidy nests in trees and bushes or on the ground in large breeding colonies. <br><br>HERONS: about 60 species of wading birds of subfamily 'Ardeinaehave' with elongated necks, legs, and bills. Bills, long, straight,  sharp edged, pointed. Wings broad. Has powder downs: areas of feathers that continually disintegrate to a fine powder used for preening (absorbing and removing fish oil, scum, and slime from the plumage).  Have four long-clawed toes on each foot, three directed forward, the fourth backward. Claw on the middle of forward toes has a rough, comblike inner margin used in preening. During breeding season many wear elongated plumes, variously on the head, back, or breast. Most construct loose, flat, platform-style nests high in branches of swamp trees; nests usually grouped in colonies. 2-6 pale blue eggs in a clutch. Most feed on aquatic animal life, but some eat insects and even mice. Most do not stalk their prey but, waiting in shallow water or on land, spear it with their long bills. Distributed worldwide but most common in tropics. Usually feed while wading quietly in shallow waters of pools, marshes, and swamps. Commonly stand with neck bent in S shape. Fly with legs trailing loosely and head held back against body, instead of stretching neck out in front as most birds do.<br><br>NIGHT HERONS form a nearly worldwide group of seven species of large-eyed nocturnal herons.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Phalacrocoracidae] /--/ [Cormorant] /--/ [Cốc] /--/ [World: 34 species, SE Asia: 5 species. Large, mostly black. Body egg-shaped. Neck long. Bill end slightly enlarged, curved, sharp. Wings short, broad, round. Feet webbed. Flight strong and direct with outstretched neck, giving a distintive sihouette. Good swimmers and divers, but walk on ground with difficulty. Swim with bill tilled upward, sometimes with only head above surface. Roost and nest in colonies in trees. Often perch with wings outstretched. Gregarious, sexes alike. Cormorants have long bill with hook at tip. Darters have more slender neck, pointed & narrow bill, longer & fan-shaped tail.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Hirundinidae] /--/ [Swallow] /--/ [Nhạn] /--/ [World: 76 species, SE Asia: 11 species; Thailand: 11 species (winter visitors). Aerial feeding insectivores, like swifts, but quite unrelated. Small, slender, graceful flyers with pointed narrow wings, short bills, and small weak feet; some species have forked tails. Differed from family 'Apodidae' (swifts) by SHORTER, BROADER wings and MORE FLUTTERING flight. Plumage may be plain or marked with metallic blue or green; the sexes look alike in most species. Frequently PERCH in the open on branches or wires. Spend much time in the air, capturing insects on the wing; they are among the most agile of passerine birds. For nesting, may use a natural hollow or cranny in a tree, or excavate their own burrow into a sandbank, or plaster mud onto a wall or ledge to house three to seven white, sometimes speckled, eggs. Gregarious, and often roost communally in large numbers outside the breeding season.<br><br>Distr.: worldwide except in coldest regions and remotest islands. Temperate-zone species include long-distance migrants.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Corvidae] /--/ [Crow / Jay / Magpie] /--/ [Quạ] /--/ [World: 110 species, SE Asia: 22 species; Thailand 11 species. Mostly large, gregarious and noisy. Perching. Fairly long tails. Notes harsh and loud. Sexes alike. Jaygs, magpies and treepies often brightly colored, generally shyer and usually stay in forested areas. Omnivrous, feed in small parties, frequently with mixed species flocks. Many species rob the nests of other birds. Most build flimsy, untidy, cup-shaped nests, usually placed in trees. Sexes similar.<br><br>CROWS are black, found on every continent except South America and Antarctica. Are among the most intelligent and adaptable of birds; several species have been able to thrive near humans. Although territorial in the breeding season, are gregarious at other times; wintering flocks may number in the thousands. Even in the breeding season, gather together to mob owls and other predators. Crows in turn may be mobbed by other birds, because their omnivorous diet includes eggs and nestlings as well as other small animals, vegetable matter, carrion, and garbage. In some agricultural areas, are considered great pests, which accounts for the invention of the scarecrow. Nests are large platforms of sticks, usually in tall trees. The three to eight eggs are deeply colored and are incubated by the female. The young are cared for by both parents. Voices are loud and usually harsh, but are characteristic for each species.<br><br>JAYS AND MAGPIES are usually more brightly colored, shyer and inhabit mostly wooded country.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Sturnidae] /--/ [Starling / Myna] /--/ [Sáo (N) / Cưỡng] /--/ [World: 104 species, SE Asia: 18 species. Medium-sized and chunky with short tails and strong pointed bills. Flight steady and direct: starlings are swift on pointed, trianguler wings; mynas have slower, round-winged flights. Range: from open country and terrestrial to forest and arboreal. Common among civilization and cultivation. Some feed around cattle. Calls loud and raucous; some have pleasant whistles. Several can be taught to talk. Popular cage birds.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Apodidae] /--/ [Swift] /--/ [Yến / én] /--/ [World: 80 species, SE Asia: 13 species; Thailand: 12 species. Similar to family 'Hirundinidae' (swallow) but wings longer, more slender and crescent-shaped with a different-looking wing-stroke: wings not extended, flight usually straight, when turning make a large round. Fly with rapid wingbeats, interspersed with long glides. Plumage compact, dull or glossy gray, brown, or black, sometimes with pale or white markings on the throat, neck, belly, or rump.  Head broad, with short, wide, slightly curved bill. Tail, although often short, may be long and deeply forked. Feet tiny and weak; with the aid of sharp claws, used only to cling to vertical surfaces. A swift that lands on flat ground may be unable to regain the air. In soft-tailed forms, the hind toe is rotated forward as an aid in gripping vertical surfaces; in spine-tailed swifts, support is gained from the short needle-tipped tail feathers, and the feet are less modified. Catch insects on the wing. NEVER perch on trees or wires like swallows but with their short claws can only hang from vertical surfaces. Spend much of their time on the wing: grooming, copulating, and, in some species, apparently even sleeping in flight. Sensitive to weather conditions, large numbers often moving ahead of rainstorms to take advantage of feeding opportunities. Best identified when forced by bad weather to descend low or when drinking or bathing, skimming low over water surface. Larger swifts among fastest flying birds in the world. Sexes alike. Gregarious. Many species have screaming calls. Nest made of twigs, buds, moss, or feathers, glued with sticky saliva to the wall of a cave or the inside of a chimney, rock crack, or hollow tree. 1-6 white eggs (usually 2-3). Both eggs and young may be allowed to cool toward the environmental temperature in times of food scarcity, slowing development and conserving resources. Young stay in nest or cling near it for 6-10 weeks, depending largely on food supply. Upon fledging, they resemble the adults and immediately fly adeptly.<br><br>SWIFTLETS: Small size. Wings more rounded, narrow and slender; forked or notched tails. Rather fluttering flight. Tail only slightly notched rather than forked and appearing almost square-ended. Nest in huge numbers in caves or sometimes buildings. Build cup nests incorporating hardened saliva which, in some species, provides material for birds' nest soup. Echolocation, audible to human ears, has been demonstrated in the 'Aerodramus' species. <br><br>SWIFTS: farily heavy-bodied with forked tails and strong flight, wings more tapered, nest on buildings or cliffs. Genus 'Chaetura': tail feathers stiff, ELONGATED into "spine". Feathers soft, NOT elongated into "spine"; side white: genus 'Apus'; side grey or brown-grey: genus 'Collocalia'; side brown-black: genus 'Cypsiurus'. Distr.: almost worldwide, are absent only from polar regions, southern Chile and Argentina, New Zealand, and most of Australia.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Malvaceae] /--/ [Cotton / Mallow] /--/ [Bụp / Bông vải] /--/ [World: 90 genera & 1570 species; Vietnam: 13 genera, 52 species.<br><br>Mostly small woody trees or shrubs, als herbs. Leaves alternate, palmately veined. Flowers showy, widely bell-shaped. Most have Epicalyx (=Hypocalyx): extra series of green sepal-like floral organs on the outside of calyx. It provides protection to the other floral organ like the calyx does. May have 5 or more bractioles; corolla of 5 petals, funnel-shaped; ovaries 5-celled; stamesn united in long tube which is truncate or 5-toothed.

[B] /--/ [Papilionaceae] /--/ [Pea] /--/ [Đậu / Đỗ] /--/ [Syn.: 'Papilionatae', 'Fabaceae'. Old name: 'Papilionoideae'. In modern taxonomy, this is in fact the largest sub-family of peas, beans... of family 'Leguminoseae'. 420 genera and 7000 species (or 490 genera and 12,000 species, depending on classification system). Common morphology: papilionaceous (butterfly-like) corolla: 5 unequal petals; 1 large bilobed & outermost petal called standard ("vexillum") partially enclosing 2 smaller petals called wings ("alae"), in turn overlapping 2 boat-shaped petals called keel ("carina"). Stamens mostly 10. Calyx with 4-5 sepals, always fused more or less to form tube. Cosmopolitan. Includes herbs, trees and shrubs (often climbing or twinning): peanut, beans, peas, dal. Aquatic forms occur in 'Aeschynomene'. Due to symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root systems, many are used as green manure and in crop rotation.  A number of species toxic to grazing animals.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Mimosaceae] /--/ [Acacia] /--/ [Mắc cỡ / Trinh nữ] /--/ [World 56 genera, nearly 2,800 species; Vietnam 13 general, 50 species. Syn.: 'Mimosoideae'. In modern taxonomy, this is in fact the smallest sub-family of acacias, mimosas... of Family 'Leguminoseae'. Mostly found in tropics and sub-tropics, often in semi-arid desert areas; most common in Africa & Australia.  Mainly trees & shrubs, rarely herbs or climbers. Aquatic plants occur in genus 'Neptunia'. Stem: erect, straggling or climbing, cylindrical, colid, woody, may be spiny; some have gum passages. Leaves mono-, bi- or tri-pinnate; leaflets small. Stipules thread-like or converted to spines. Flowers usually small, in round inflorescence. Sepals 5, fused or separate, toothed above. Petals 5, fused or separate. Stamens many or double number of petals; filaments free.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Caesalpiniaceae] /--/ [Cassia] /--/ [Điệp / Vang] /--/ [Also known as sub-family 'Caesalpinioideae' of the family 'Leguminosae' which contains 600+ genera & 13,000 species. It is the second largest family of the class 'Dicotyledoneae', the first being 'Compositae'. Mainly trees and shrubs, some are climbers, rarely herbs. Many plants have tannin sacs and gum passages in stems and branches. Leaves mono- or bi-pinnate, sometimes with 1 pair of leaflets, sometime mono-folilate by union of these. Flowers irregular, bi-sexual, more typically pea-like by may open wider and be less zygomorphic; calyx 4- or 5-lobed; petals 5 or rarely zero. Stamens 10, sometimes reduced to staminodes. Ovaries free or united. Pods dehiscent or indehiscent.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Asteraceae] /--/ [Sunflower / Aster] /--/ [Cúc] /--/ [Syn.: 'Compositae'. The old family name refers to the clustering of the flowers into compact heads so that an entire cluster resembles a single flower. The largest family of angiosperms with some 1000 genera and 23,000 species, roughly 7% of total flowering plants; Vietnam: 75 genera, 200 species. Mainly herbs, some climbers, shrubs, sub-shrubs, or small trees. Consists of food plants: lettuce, chicory, artichoke; horticultural members: marigold, dahlia, zinnia, daisy, cosmos, chrysanthemum, tansy, and aster, etc; oil seeds: sunflower, sesame. Weedy members of the family include dandelion, thistle, cocklebur, and ragweed, which is a major source of the airborne pollen that affects hay fever sufferers.<br>Often posses latex or oil passages. Common morphology: capitulum inflorescence with ray & disc florets (from a few to several thousand), both types are surrounded by bracts at the base, arranged in whorls or umbels; sessile pedicels, epigynous flowers, cypela fruits, carpels of basal placentation. Petals of the florets are fused along the base, forming a somewhat tubular corolla. Sepals vary in shapes but NEVER LEAF-LIKE: may be hair-like or scale-like, which often aid in distribution of seeds, or totally absent. Anthers are joined to form a tube through which the style (part of the female flower part) extends. The anthers release the pollen into the tube, and as the style elongates, it pushes the pollen upward out of the tube, making it available to insect pollinators or to wind dispersal. The stigmatic areas of the style are located on two branches of the style tip, and these branches separate after elongation. Thus, self-pollination is usually avoided, although in some cases the stigmatic branches recurve backward into the pollen-bearing anther tube. The single-ovary pistil bears the other flower parts on its apex. After fertilization it matures into a hard-coated single-seed fruit , often disseminated by wind thanks to a whorl of hairs (some umbrella-like).<br>Distr: cosmopolitan in almost all wild habitats and climates except for Antarctica; Vietnam from coasts to 3000 m. Habitat: particularly well adapted to semiarid parts of tropical and subtropical regions, to arctic and alpine tundra, and to temperate regions. Poorly represented only in tropical rain forests.<br>] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Solanaceae] /--/ [Potato / Nightshade] /--/ [Cà] /--/ [World: about 90 genera and 2,300 species, centered in tropical America; Vietnam: 9 genera, 29 species, common nationwide.<br><br>Herbs, semi-shrubs or shrubs, rarely soft-wooded trees, few are climbers. Many of human foods (potato, tomato, chili, pepper, eggplant) and drugs come from this important family which also contains many very poisonous plants. Stem: erect, rarely climbing or prostrate, herbaceous or woody, solid or fistular, hairs or prickles often present. Leaves singular, entire or quite deeply lobed, NO STIPULE. Flowers in cymes, sometimes twisted cymes, commonly wheel-shaped, often attractive; 5 united petals surrounded by a persistent calyx more or less united; 5 sepals which may later enclose the fruit. Stamens usually 5, seldom 4 or 2, sometimes protrude from corolla tube in characteristic way.<br><br>Distr.: the majority in tropial and sub-tropical regions, but a fair number in temperate areas.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Phasianidae] /--/ [Partridge / Pheasant] /--/ [Gà lôi / Chim trĩ] /--/ [World: 178 species, SE Asia: at least 41 species including 2 rare not listed by King (1975); Vietnam: 22 species. Terrestrial. Often run from danger rather than fly. Very difficult to observe, but most have loud and distinct calls. Except for quails, most are absent near civilisation.<br>QUAILS: 130 species (95 species of Old World quail classified in two subfamilies, 'Phasianinae' or 'Perdicinae'.  Resembling partridges but generally smaller and less robust. Round, very short-tailed, usually cannot be differentiated in field. New World quail (some 36 species, constituting the subfamily 'Odontophorinae') more nearly resemble Old World partridges. Prefer open grass country and brushy borders. In spring the hen lays about 12 roundish eggs, which the male may help incubate. The young remain with their parents the first summer. Diet: mainly seeds and berries but also leaves, roots, some insects. Flesh & eggs considered a delicacy.<br><br>PARTRIDGES: larger than quail, with stronger bills and feet, somewhat longer tails, mostly in forest and second growth. Native to the Old World. Some New World grouse and quails are erroneously called partridges.<br><br>PHEASANTS: some 50 species in about 16 genera of subfamily 'Phasianinaelarge'. Larger than partridges, with longer tails, plumage often elaborate and beautiful, mainly in forests. Some species in second growth and grass, where they feed in small flocks. All have hoarse calls and a variety of other notes. Males mostly strikingly coloured; females inconspicuously coloured. A male pheasant, pugnacious in breeding season, has one or more leg spurs and may have fleshy ornaments on the face. Courting males sometimes fight to the death in the presence of hens, who seem utterly indifferent to the commotion. Distr.: originally from China to Malaysia. Several species have been naturalized elsewhere (two thousand years ago or so in Anatolia and Europe) and many are prized as ornamentals in zoos and private collections; they are also raised for sport in shooting preserves. Some species have been brought to the verge of extinction by hunting.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Orchidaceae] /--/ [Orchid] /--/ [Phong lan] /--/ [Huge family: 800 genera, 35,000 species (new discoveries made every year); Indochina: 101 genera, 570+ species; Vietnam: 91 genera, 463 (901?) species. Morphology highly variable: as small as lichen (2-3 mm), some creepers up to 40 m. No universally-agreed taxonomy system. Many genera & species have synonyms. Primary hybrids named with epithets consisting of 1 to 3 words in any language. More complex hybrids identified by 1 or 2 words in any language enclosed in ' '.<br>Roots with a sponge-like layer of tissues called "velamen" covering true root inside, facilitating absorption of water and nutrients, also highly important for water conservation and protection from strong sunlight. Green leaves play the actual role of food manufacturing. Two different types of growth structure. (1) Most sympodial: a new stem developed  each year along a horizontal axis so rhizome often much branched; stem often has a swollen, bulb-like region termed "pseudobulb". (2) Monopodial:  with neither rhizome nor pseudobulb, axillary shoots developed from the vegetative apex, so stem grows taller each year, adding more leaves and flowers.<br>Flowers either solitary or in groups, always with a bract. All with same bilaterally symmetrical flower structure: each has 2 sets of petals with 3 inner and 3 outer ones. 3 inner petals with an identical pair and a singular one, a "lip" or "labellum", with distinctive shape and color, often brighter, usually the lowest part of the flower. Outer petals generally smaller, without vivid color as inner petals, either an identical pair plus a singular one like the inner ones, or all 3 may look the same. Style fused with filament and anther. Most have 1 stamen at top of column, rarely 2 at sides. Pollen grains, contained within lobes at top of stamen, grouped into tightly squeezed mealy or waxy masses termed "pollinia", usually transferred from one flower to another by insects or birds, although some species are wind- or self-pollinated. Pods or capsules take 6 months to 1 year to ripe, some contains millions of seeds, airborne until landing, covered by mycorrhiza fungus which helps in finding food during the first part of the seedling's growth. Most bloom once a year, rarely more often.<br>The only economically important product derived from an orchid is vanilla, obtained from seedpod of several species of genus 'Vanilla'. Thousands of hybrids have been developed as ornamentals.<br>Distr.: wild mainly SE Asia and C Americas, also in temperate climates and Arctic Circle. Habitat: mainly moist forests but also up to snow lines on mountains. Mostly epiphytic (root's main duty is to grasp and cling to larger structures) and lithophytic (in crevices of rock); also terrestrial or even subterranean.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Tytonidae] /--/ [Owl, barn / Owl, bay] /--/ [Cú lợn] /--/ [About a dozen species. Differ from the typical owls in having a heart-shaped face rather than a circular one. Also have longer legs and smaller eyes, which are never yellow as in some typical owls. Most have mottled brown upperparts and, except for the sooty owl of Australia, pale underparts, usually lightly speckled. Large eyes, directed forward, set in large facial discs.  Nocturnal, soft plumage, big heads, hooked bills, powerful talons and short tails. Food consists principally of small mammals. Fly silently on broad rounded wings. Sexes alike. Solitary.

Classified in approximately 75 to 80 genera and 6 subfamilies.<br><br>World: 317 species, SE Asia: 9; Vietnam: 8; Thailand: 7. Bill short, round and strongly hooked. Heads large. Plumage mostly green. Wings narrow and pointed. Flight swift, direct. Feed in trees, sometimes on crops. Climb about in branches, often using bills as an aid. Eat mainly fruit or grains, manipulate food with zygodactylous feet. Gregarious, often form large flocks with loose communal roosts. Hole-nesting. Eggs small; usually 2-5 each batch; shells always white. Babies weak, naked, leave nest after 2-3 months. Popular cage birds, escapes often found far from normal range. Larger species have been much reduced by illegal bird trade. Diet: soft seeds & fruit, some eat insects. Long lifespan, can reach 50 years.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Accipitridae] /--/ [Kite / Hawk / Eagle] /--/ [Diều / Ưng / Đại bàng] /--/ [World: 224 species; SE Asia: 50; Vietnam: 22. Sharp & hooked bills, strong feet, sharp claws, long wings. Diet: insects, reptiles, birds, small mammals, fish. Best field marks are often shape and markings in flights. Close similarity of many species, great range of plumage variation (different color and even pattern phases, plus usually distinct immature plumages), difficulty of close observation, and limited field data, all make it impossible to identify many individuals.<br>KITES ('Elanus', 'Haliastur', 'Milvus'): about 21 diverse species, not all closely related. Medium-sized; soar and glide gracefully on long, angular wings, mostly in open country. Found in warmer portions of all continents and many tropical islands. Legs and feet are smaller and weaker than of most other hawks, and consequently their diet, which varies among different species, is made up of very small animals or of carrion. Nearly all nest in trees.<br>HAWKS ('Accipiter', 'Aviceda', 'Machaerhamphus'): No clearcut definition of what constitutes a hawk. Small to medium, fly with several rapid flaps and a short glide, sometimes soar; most species hunt inside wooded areas. Some hawks in N America are known as buzzards in Eurasia. TRUE HAWKS are 48 species of genus 'Accipiter' that also includes goshawks and sparrow hawks. All hawks feed on living prey but tend to specialize partly based on size: smallest hawks feed primarily on insects, and "bird hawks" choose their feathered prey in accordance with their own relative size. Some prefer amphibians and reptiles. The majority feed principally on appropriately sized mammals. Most build bulky nests of twigs, bark, and leaves high in trees. Eggs are usually white or bluish-white, variably blotched and spotted with shades of brown. The young are covered with white down and relatively helpless at hatching. They grow slowly and are dependent on their parents for food even after they have fledged.<br>BUZZARDS ('Butastur', 'Buteo', 'Pernis'): common name used in most English-speaking world for certain hawks. Medium-sized; soar in wide circles on long wings; heads and bills smaller in proportion than eagles.<br>EAGLES ('Aquila', 'Circaetus', 'Haliaeetus', 'Hieraaetus', 'Icthyophaga', 'Ictinaetus', 'Splilornis') is common name for a number of diurnal birds of prey, some of which are the largest members of the family. The name eagle is somewhat loosely applied, as several of the groups are not particularly closely related to one another, and some birds called hawks are larger than some called eagles. Majestic soarers with large bills, heads project more than buzzards.<br>VULTURES: masterful soarers with featherless or partially down-covered heads and hooked bill Scavengers, occasionally attacking newborn or wounded living animals. Most hunt by sight, soaring and watching for other vultures descending to feed.] /--/

Most coloured in drab grays and browns. With the exception of a few strongly migratory species, most short-winged. All have long (sometimes extremely long), graduated tails, usually with the individual feathers tipped with white. Legs vary from medium to rather long (in the terrestrial forms) and the feet are zygodactyl; i.e., with 2 toes pointing forward and 2 back. Bill rather stout, somewhat downcurved.  Great majority non-migratory. Solitary. Most monogamous, some polygamous. A highly varied family; most insectivorous. 4 groups: (1) Parasitic cuckoos 'Clamator', 'Cuculus', 'Cacomantis', 'Chrysococcyx', 'Surniculus' & 'Eudynamys'. Most shy & difficult to oberve but have distinctive calls; (2) malkohas 'Phaenicophaeus': rather large, very long tails; (3) ground cuckoos 'Carpococcyx' large, very long tailed, terrestrial; (4) coucals or crow-pheasants 'Centropus': rather large birds of ground, grass & bushes.<br><br>Distr.: worldwide, found in temperate and tropical regions but most diverse in the Old World tropics. Tend to be shy inhabitants of thick vegetation, more often heard than seen. <br><br>Brood parasitism in all of subfamily 'Cuculinae' and 3 species of 'Phaenicophaeinae'. It consists of laying the eggs singly in the nests of certain other bird species to be incubated by the foster parents, who rear the young cuckoo. Various adaptations enhance the survival of the young cuckoo: egg mimicry in which the cuckoo egg resembles that of the host thus minimizing rejection by the host;  short incubation periods (11-15 days); removal of one or more host eggs by the adult cuckoo; reducing both the competition from host nestlings and the danger of recognition by the host that an egg has been added to the nest; and nest-mate ejection, in which the young cuckoo heaves from the nest the host's eggs and nestlings. Young birds grow very fast, often leave nest after 3 weeks.] /--/

Sexually dimorphic; the males have brighter plumage than the females. Wavy barring on wing coverts is whitish grey in males and buffy in females. Short, broad wings. Fairly long, broad and square-cut tails. Short, broad, light blue or purplish bills. Soft fluffy plumage. Feet weak, covered by feathers; 1st & 2nd toes in front, 3rd & 4th back. Short legs; rest on branches with an upright posture, usually in the middle storey of forest. Rather quiet, shy, middle story forest birds. In addition to diagnostic territorial calls, all species have similar dry whirring notes, which may be given by both sexes. Feed primarily on insects, often caught on short flights from perch. Nest in tree hollow or dig into soft, decayed trunk, some in ground hollow or termite. Lay eggs into hole without any bedding material, 2-4 eggs each batch, nearly round.

A large and diverse family, characterised by flattened, broad-based bills with long rictal bristles and short, slender legs. Sexes often differ, with bright-plumaged males being more readily identifiable than duller, brownish females. Juvenile plumages are spotted or mottled. Mainly insectivorous. Many species show an upright posture, sit on exposed perches, and make brief sorties after flying insects while others feed close to the ground in forest undergrowth, gleaning insects from foliage. Most have harsh call-notes and sweet, warbling songs.

Immatures of 3 species in SE Asia difficult to separate in field. Body short.  Also called man-o'-war birds, size quite large, about 1.5 kg. Noted for extremely long, slender, angular, pointed  wings, a larger wingspan in proportion to their weight than any other bird (may reach 2.3 m). Tail long, deeply forked.  In general, adult males all black, adult females marked with white below. Juveniles have pale, either white or rufous heads and usually a dark breast band. Feet tiny, almost helpless with 4 partially webbed toes. Bill long, hooked, used in attacking and robbing other seabirds of their fish.

Heavily built, long-winged, web-footed, the most familiar birds of the seashore. Bill strong, slightly hooked. Bill and leg colours help to distinguish species, as do wing patterns. Adults mostly white with grey wings & mantle, with variable head markings; immatures usually have some brown (some entirely mottled brown) in plumage. Adult plumage often acquired through graded series of intermediate plumages requiring several years. Foraging includes fishing, scavenging, taking eggs and young of other birds (including their own kind), insect catching, following plows for earthworms and ships for garbage, dropping shellfish from a height to break them open, and foot paddling to stir up organisms in shallow water. Frequently sit on water. Larger gulls drive out smaller gulls and terns from nesting territories, partly through egg and chick predation. Breed colonially, mostly on the flat ground of beaches, marshes, or riverbeds, building simple, shallow, grass-lined nests. Several species nest on ledges of cliffs. Clutch consists of two or three greenish-brown, speckled eggs, taking 20-30 days to incubate. Hatching chicks have down feathers, and the eyes are open. Chicks can stand but are dependent on parents for food and warmth. Parents share in incubation of eggs and in brooding & feeding (by regurgitation) of chicks, which fledge between 4-6 weeks after hatching. Known to live up to 40 years in captivity and 36 years in the wild. Winter visitors only in Thailand.<br>TERNS:  subfamily 'Sterninae', more slender;  short legs; long, narrow, pointed wings; long, slim, pointed bills; usually forked tails, often with elongated outer feathers.

Many migrate long distances. Most inhabit ocean coasts. Feed on fish and small marine invertebrates by diving down into water from air ('Sterna') or plucking from surface with bill while flying ('Chlidonias'). Most nest on the ground in dense colonies in open areas such as beach or tundra; nests vary from a simple depression to an elaborate structure of twigs, grass, and bits of shell. Tropical terns rarely lay more than 1 egg, but northern species often lay 3 and occasionally 4. Long-lived. Individuals continuing to breed at well over 20 years of age.

Small to medium-sized long-legged waders of shores of lakes, rivers, marshes & sea coasts. Plumages often intricately mottled; juvenile and breeding plumages are usually brighter than the dull greys and browns of winter plumage. Identification is facilitated by distinctive field characters such as wing bars, tail pattern and flight calls, together with size and shape. Usually important identification characteristics of flight pattern of wings, rump and tail are retained in all plumages. Bills long, slender, used to probe in soft mud or water. Gregarious in the non-breeding season, when form large mixed-species roosting and feeding flocks. Migrate long distances on long, narrow, pointed wings. None breed in SE Asia, but some are present 11 months of year. Often noisy. Bills & legs often covered with mud, making it difficult to see color. Sexes usually alike.<br><br>SANDPIPERS: several species, 15-30 cm. have moderately long bills and legs, long, narrow wings, and fairly short tails.

Feed on beaches and mud flats of ocean coastlines and inland waters, running along near the water and picking up insects, crustaceans, and worms. Utter thin, piping cries while in flight or while running along the sand. Usually nest on the ground in the open, in a scantily lined little hollow. Lay 4 spotted eggs, from which hatch active, downy young.

Intermediate in size and build between large ducks and the swans, less fully aquatic than either of these relatives. Sexes alike, though males usually larger than females. Neck always shorter than body. Bill humped at base, tapered toward tip; plates adapted for grasping sedges and grasses as food. Legs farther forward than in swans and ducks, allowing the bird to walk readily. Both sexes utter loud honking or gabbling cries while on the wing or when danger appears. When angry, vibrate neck feathers; after routing an enemy, the male utters a triumph note, echoed by his mate and young goslings. Pair for life. Build a simple nest on the ground. 3-12 rough-surfaced, whitish eggs incubated for 24-33 days by the hen while the male stands guard. Young fend for themselves almost at once but receive care during their first summer. May survive for 10-15 years in the wild, more than 30 years in captivity. Migratory, winter in limited localities far south of their breeding grounds. Powerful and high fliers, travel in V-formation.<br><br>DUCKS differ from geese and swans by shorter necks and legs and other anatomical differences. Inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and most of the world's islands. Most with legs placed far apart and toward the rear, making them awkward walkers but efficient swimmers. Down is kept water-resistant by frequent preening with oil from the uropygial or preen gland, at the base of the tail feathers. With the exception of mergansers, have spatulate bills lined with bony notches, or lamellae, for straining plant and animal matter from water. Mature in the first year and pair only for the season -- unlike the late-maturing, life-mating true geese and swans. Some island species have lost the power of flight, but most ducks of northern continents are highly migratory. In a few species, the sexes are alike in color, but in most the males are brighter and more boldly patterned. Have elaborate courtship displays, each unique to its species. Nests of most species are on ground. 4 to 12 eggs surrounded by down feathers plucked from female's breast and belly. Ducklings are able to swim and feed themselves soon after they hatch.] /--/

Others, especially those that live in grass or low bushes, are demurely clad and protectively colored, though even these may be attractively spotted and streaked. Most use their THICK CONICAL bills to crack seeds of grasses and weeds. Many supplement their diet with insects as well. Nestlings unable to crack seeds and so usually fed insects. Females of most species build a cup-shaped nest of twigs, grasses, and roots on the ground or in bushes and lay 4-5 eggs. Sometimes the female incubates them alone, but usually the male assists in raising the young. 2 or 3 broods may be raised in a season. Generally nest in scattered pairs but highly gregarious at other times and are often seen in large flocks.

Most eat insects. In spring the loud calls, often augmented by drumming on hollow wood or occasionally on metal, are the sounds of males holding territories; at other seasons usually silent. Most not social, tending rather to be solitary or to travel in pairs.] /--/

[Z] /--/ [Soricidae] /--/ [Shrew] /--/ [ ] /--/ [World: 24 genera, 290 species. An ancient family, descended from early mole-like forms. The smallest insectivores, with short legs, 5 clawed toes, relatively long tail, short dense fur, small external ears, and elongated snout. Eyes small, compressed by the temporal & snot muscles, which are developed for shovelling through leaf mold and decaying vegetation in order to sniff out insects. Dentition is diagnostic for the family. Nervous, high-strung: respiration rate 850/min. and heart rate of 800 beats/min, increasing to 1200 beats/min. when alarmed. Although basically nocturnal, active almost continuously to search for sufficient food to maintain high body temperature and rapid metabolic rate. Diet is primarily insects, though will eat any small creature. Smallest shrews can starve to death in 8-12 hours, and eat as much as 3 times their body weight a day; largest shrews may eat their own weight a day. Most breed at least twice a year; litter size 2-10; gestation 16-35 days. Newborn small, pink, with translucent skin revealing internal organs in some species; they nurse for 17-18 days, reach adult size in 40-50 days. Two subfamilies: 'Soricinae' with pigmented teeth, and 'Crocidurinae' with white teeth. Distr: originating from Eurasia, species migrated to Africa & N America, and one genus 'Eryptotis' has reached northern South America. Quite rare in SE Asia, about 6 species in Thailand & Malaya.] /--/

Lorises (from Dutch "loeris", meaning "clown") are small, heavy set, tail short or absent, head & eyes rounded, muzzle short & pointed, ears small & round. Thumb & 1st toe relatively large, capable of considerable backward extension; index finger reduced; palm wide and well padded, giving an extremely powerful grip that can be maintained for quite a long time. All digits have nails except 2nd digit of hindfeet, which have a short claw. Nocturnal. Slow, usually move 1 limb at a time while maintaing their grip with the other 3 feet. Usually spend the day curled up in trees with head and hands tucked between thighs. Engage in social grooming.] /--/ 
[Z] /--/ [Manidae] /--/ [Pangolin] /--/ [Tê tê] /--/ [Single family of order 'Pholidota' ("scaled animals"), with 7 species, 3 in Asia. Distr: tropical Africa & Asia. All species quite similar externally. Most distinctive feature: scaly covering of the dorsum: entire upper side of body, except muzzle and cheeks, covered with brownish grey overlapping horny scales. Scales made of agglutinated hairs, similar to rhinoceros horn; those nearest belly on both sides are sharply keeled. Legs short. Body long, tapering to conical head and long prehensile tail. Tongue 50% longer than head and body, housed in a sheath in stomach, with muscles controlling it anchored to the pelvis, covered with vey sticky saliva to which ants and termites adhere. Nocturnal, spending the day curled in a burrow. Excellent tree climbers, using "caterpillar locomotion".

Born with 3 pairs of upper incisors, 1 soon lost, the others grow continuously throughout life. 5 clawed toes on front feet, 4 or 5 on hind feet (the 5th reduced when present). No noticeable footpads; sole completely covered with hairs (rodents usually have well-developed footpads). Some hares capable of speeds up to 80 km/h. Females usually larger than males (the reverse in rodents and most other animals). Testes are external (internal in rodents, except when breeding). Tail short or lacking (usually long in rodents). Rabbits born blind and nearly hairless, usually in a burrow, while hares born with eyes open and fully haired, usually in the open. Lagomorphs have unique habit of "refection": eating their own night-time droppings covered with a jelly-like substance that keeps the droppings soft and wet until the morning when they are consumed. Bacterial activity while the droppings are exposed to air forms essential vitamins, thus refection is analogous to rumination.

Often referred to as the cobra family, although the genus 'Naja' has only 6 species, and other cobras are represeented by a further 6 species contained within 5 gnera. 3 sub-families: (1) 'Elapinae'; (2) 'Hydrophiinae' also considered as the family 'Hydrophiidae', containing majority of sea snakes; and (3) 'Laticaudinae'. Many species are not readily distinguishable from the rear-fanged family 'Colubridae.'<br><br>Majority are slender. None has a loreal scales. All have highly toxic venom, often fatal to humans. Includes some of the world's most dangerous snakes. All possess fixed hollow front fangs situated in the front of the upper jaw. Fangs are enclosed venom canals and not grooved as in the rear-fanged snakes. Although fangs are fixed, there is some varying rotary movement. Actual venom gland is toughly encapsulated, situated in most cases between the eye and the rear of the upper jaw. Majority are either terrestrial or arboreal.
