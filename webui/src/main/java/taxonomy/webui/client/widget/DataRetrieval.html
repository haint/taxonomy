    <h4>HOW TO WORK WITH DATA RETRIEVAL (Will be replaced by FullText search feature)</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    Just start experiment and enjoy it! You may want to try <strong>Keyword Listing</strong> to list terms currently used in this database,
    but this is seldom necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enter a word in field provided, and the system will search for records with the corresponding fields containing that word anywhere in the name.
  </p>  
  <p>
    For example, with the criteria of: English name of <strong>CARP</strong>, you will get records with English names like '<strong>CARP</strong>
    ,<strong>COMMON</strong>' and '<strong>CARP</strong>,<strong>GRASS</strong>', meaning all carps in the database.
  <p/>
  <p>
    To search for compounds terms, entire words at left or right can be omitted: '<strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong>' will give both '<strong>so-and-so development</strong>'
    and '<strong>development so-and-so</strong>'. But words can be right-truncated only. '<strong>CHEMI</strong>' in the search criteria will give
    <strong>CHEMISTRY</strong>, <strong>CHEMICAL ENGINEERING</strong>..., but not <strong>BIOCHEMISTRY</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leave blank for any unused retrieval criterion, and this means <strong>any</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Retrieved information displayed may contain data from more than one databases and not the same as <strong>Record Listing</strong> display which
    works with single databases.
