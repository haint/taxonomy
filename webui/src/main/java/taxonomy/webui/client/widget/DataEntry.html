    <h4>HOW TO WORK WITH DATA ENTRY (Out of date)</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    You will be presented with a worksheet of one record having field headings and field space. <strong>OBSERVE:</strong> (1) the first line
    of the screen to know the keyboard status (insert `lns' vs typeover, and upper `Caps' vs lowercase); and (2) the last line for instructions on how
    to enter data and messages. Observe also the <strong>RECORD NO</strong> when available. When deleting or editing a record you often need to know
    its number
   </p>
   <p>
    Unlike when responding to prompts, the system requires you to confirm each field entry, so you have to <strong>PRESS ENTER AFTER EACH FIELD</strong>
    . To go to the previous field, use key <strong>ARROW UP</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moving up from the first field, pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> at the last field, or moving down from the last field all indicate the you're finished
    with the current record. So you should be careful at the first or last field, otherwise the current worksheet will be saved while you may not finish with it
    . To edit a record, go back to the main menu of the database.
    </p>

    The system can perform a certain level of data validation. This feature will stop you when you enter invalid data. If you don't understand why, try 
    to think! Even with data validation, you <strong>SHOULD PROOFREAD YOUR DATA</strong> either on-screen or in printout. The system is designed
    to facilitate this work.
