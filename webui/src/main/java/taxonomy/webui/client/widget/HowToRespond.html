    <h4>HOW TO RESPOND (DEPRECATED)</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    You're already known how to respond to the system !
    <br/>
    Just follow the prompt, then type your choice at this sign: <strong>===></strong>. Use any combination of uppercase/lowercase (although uppercase is ussually preset).
    <br/>
    If you do not use all of the space provided at the prompt, press <strong>ENTER</strong> when you finish your answer.
    <br/>
    If the provided space already contains data (default), you may:
    <ul>
      <li>either press <strong>ENTER</strong> to accept the default data</li>
      <li>or type new data, ingoring old data (no need to delete it)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    Some control may be in effect, eg. you can't enter letters in numeric fields. In this case, what you enter will not appear; just try again.
    <br/>
    The system will repeat the same prompt, if you choose an incorrect answer. Otherwise, it will not know how to proceed!
    <br/>
    In multi-field prompts, to go to the next field use key <strong>ENTER</strong>, and go to the previous field use key <strong>ARROW UP</strong>
