    <h4>TAXONOMY DATABASE SYSTEM</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    Besides the main database, two optional ones are for taxonomic families and genera,
    which store additional information on families and genera, respectively
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important that you enter <strong>Family</strong> names in the main database in corresponding with name in the <strong>Family</strong> database.
    This is to ensure that the two databases are linked with each other properly.
    The same is true for <strong>Genus</strong> names in the main database and in the <strong>Genus</strong> database.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is one database for <strong>Keywords</strong>, and another for <strong>Indexing</strong> terms. You should maintain these databases to be
    consistent with the main ones.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      The system is designed based on the one-entry one-exit basics. This means that you should exit from the system by the first menu so that file are
      closed properly. Falling to do so may corrupt your databases.

  <p>
    <strong>INDEXING</strong> is normally not neccessary. It is required only when data indecies are corrupted due to some reason. 
    You may try it when having problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>DATA VALIDATION</strong> is to maintain data integrity. For this reason, it is run only by personnel in charge.

  <blockquote>
    <p>Although this is rare, a problem may cause the program to stop and ask if you want to cancel, ignore or suspend. Try to remember what
    you just did, note down the message, then type <strong>C</strong> to <strong>CANCEL</strong>. Then enter the command <strong>QUIT</strong>
    to exit from the program. Stop using the program until the problem has been fixed.
    <br/>
    It is very difficult to rebuild a lost database. So, remember: <strong>BACKUP</strong> and <strong>BACKUP</strong> !
