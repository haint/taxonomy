Several hundred new contemporary rose cultivars are introduced each year.<br>The classification of cultivated roses is complicated, because of the great numbers of cultivars involved and the amount of artificial hybridization that has taken place. Generally, the classes of old roses are based on selection from one or a few ancestral species or hybrids. Among the popular classes are the hybrid perpetuals, or remontant roses, which produce large, fragrant double flowers in early summer and fewer flowers in autumn, derived mainly from the hybrid species ''Rosa borboniana''. The class of polyantha roses includes many dwarf forms, with flowers produced in dense clusters, derived from the hybrid species ''Rosa rehderana''. Tea roses and China roses are old-rose classes from which the contemporary hybrid tea roses have been derived through hybridization with hybrid perpetual roses. Tea roses were derived from ''Rosa odorata''; and China roses from ''Rosa odorata'' and ''Rosa chinensis''. Hybrid tea roses are less hardy but more recurrent-blooming than the old hybrid perpetuals and contain a much wider variety of color and flower form.
