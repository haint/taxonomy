Plumage brown, yellow and black, variously striped and speckled. Solitary, inhabiting reedy and marshy places. At the approach of a potential predator, stand motionless with head up and neck vertical so that their brown-streaked plumage makes them almost indistinguishable from the surrounding reeds. Sluggish, and its flight slow and of short duration. When attacked, use both bill and claws for defense. Make a rude nest of sticks or reeds. 4-5 greenish-brown eggs. Diet: fish, frogs, crayfish, and other small swamp and marsh animals, speared by sharp-pointed bills. Occur almost worldwide.<br><br>EGRETS: various wading species, especially those having white plumage and bearing long, soft plumes on the lower parts of their backs during the breeding season. Some perform elaborate mating displays involving plumes. Typically frequent marshes, lakes, humid forests, and other wetland environments. Catch small fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and crustaceans in shallow waters. They build large, untidy nests in trees and bushes or on the ground in large breeding colonies. <br><br>HERONS: about 60 species of wading birds of subfamily ''Ardeinaehave'' with elongated necks, legs, and bills. Bills, long, straight,  sharp edged, pointed. Wings broad. Has powder downs: areas of feathers that continually disintegrate to a fine powder used for preening (absorbing and removing fish oil, scum, and slime from the plumage).  Have four long-clawed toes on each foot, three directed forward, the fourth backward. Claw on the middle of forward toes has a rough, comblike inner margin used in preening. During breeding season many wear elongated plumes, variously on the head, back, or breast. Most construct loose, flat, platform-style nests high in branches of swamp trees; nests usually grouped in colonies. 2-6 pale blue eggs in a clutch. Most feed on aquatic animal life, but some eat insects and even mice. Most do not stalk their prey but, waiting in shallow water or on land, spear it with their long bills. Distributed worldwide but most common in tropics. Usually feed while wading quietly in shallow waters of pools, marshes, and swamps. Commonly stand with neck bent in S shape. Fly with legs trailing loosely and head held back against body, instead of stretching neck out in front as most birds do.<br><br>NIGHT HERONS form a nearly worldwide group of seven species of large-eyed nocturnal herons.', ' ');

Weedy members of the family include dandelion, thistle, cocklebur, and ragweed, which is a major source of the airborne pollen that affects hay fever sufferers.<br>Often posses latex or oil passages. Common morphology: capitulum inflorescence with ray & disc florets (from a few to several thousand), both types are surrounded by bracts at the base, arranged in whorls or umbels; sessile pedicels, epigynous flowers, cypela fruits, carpels of basal placentation. Petals of the florets are fused along the base, forming a somewhat tubular corolla. Sepals vary in shapes but NEVER LEAF-LIKE: may be hair-like or scale-like, which often aid in distribution of seeds, or totally absent. Anthers are joined to form a tube through which the style (part of the female flower part) extends. The anthers release the pollen into the tube, and as the style elongates, it pushes the pollen upward out of the tube, making it available to insect pollinators or to wind dispersal. The stigmatic areas of the style are located on two branches of the style tip, and these branches separate after elongation. Thus, self-pollination is usually avoided, although in some cases the stigmatic branches recurve backward into the pollen-bearing anther tube. The single-ovary pistil bears the other flower parts on its apex. After fertilization it matures into a hard-coated single-seed fruit , often disseminated by wind thanks to a whorl of hairs (some umbrella-like).<br>Distr: cosmopolitan in almost all wild habitats and climates except for Antarctica; Vietnam from coasts to 3000 m.

Tend to be shy inhabitants of thick vegetation, more often heard than seen. <br><br>Brood parasitism in all of subfamily ''Cuculinae'' and 3 species of ''Phaenicophaeinae''. It consists of laying the eggs singly in the nests of certain other bird species to be incubated by the foster parents, who rear the young cuckoo. Various adaptations enhance the survival of the young cuckoo: egg mimicry in which the cuckoo egg resembles that of the host thus minimizing rejection by the host;  short incubation periods (11-15 days); removal of one or more host eggs by the adult cuckoo; reducing both the competition from host nestlings and the danger of recognition by the host that an egg has been added to the nest; and nest-mate ejection, in which the young cuckoo heaves from the nest the host''s eggs and nestlings. Young birds grow very fast, often leave nest after 3 weeks.', ' ');

Flight strong, fast and direct with neck fully extended and usually with continuous flapping. Mostly aquatic. Males of many species whose sexes differ have an eclipse plumage in fall similar to female. Intermediate male plumages can be confusing. Most northern migrants to SE Asia have female-type plumage. Gregarious.<br>Obtain food in shallow marshes by diving, surface feeding, or tipping up with head under water ''Dendrocygna'', ''Anas'', ''Aix'', ''Nettapus'', ''Sarkidiornis'', ''Cairina'' - these hold high tail above water when swimming, take off directly into air.<br>Dive in deeper, more open water: ''Netta'', ''Aythya'', ''Bucephala'', ''Mergus'' - these hold tail close to water when swimming, patter along water surface with feet before taking flight.<br>Some graze or eat grain in field: ''Anser'', ''Dendrocygna'', ''Tadorna'', ''Anas'', ''Nettapus'', Sarkidiornis'', ''Cairina''.<br><br>GEESE: of subfamily ''Anserinae''. Intermediate in size and build between large ducks and the swans, less fully aquatic than either of these relatives. Sexes alike, though males usually larger than females. Neck always shorter than body. Bill humped at base, tapered toward tip; plates adapted for grasping sedges and grasses as food. Legs farther forward than in swans and ducks, allowing the bird to walk readily. Both sexes utter loud honking or gabbling cries while on the wing or when danger appears. When angry, vibrate neck feathers; after routing an enemy, the male utters a triumph note, echoed by his mate and young goslings. Pair for life. Build a simple nest on the ground. 3-12 rough-surfaced, whitish eggs incubated for 24-33 days by the hen while the male stands guard. Young fend for themselves almost at once but receive care during their first summer. May survive for 10-15 years in the wild, more than 30 years in captivity. Migratory, winter in limited localities far south of their breeding grounds. Powerful and high fliers, travel in V-formation.<br><br>DUCKS differ from geese and swans by shorter necks and legs and other anatomical differences. Inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and most of the world''s islands. Most with legs placed far apart and toward the rear, making them awkward walkers but efficient swimmers. Down is kept water-resistant by frequent preening with oil from the uropygial or preen gland, at the base of the tail feathers. With the exception of mergansers, have spatulate bills lined with bony notches, or lamellae, for straining plant and animal matter from water. Mature in the first year and pair only for the season -- unlike the late-maturing, life-mating true geese and swans. Some island species have lost the power of flight, but most ducks of northern continents are highly migratory. In a few species, the sexes are alike in color, but in most the males are brighter and more boldly patterned. Have elaborate courtship displays, each unique to its species. Nests of most species are on ground. 4 to 12 eggs surrounded by down feathers plucked from female''s breast and belly. Ducklings are able to swim and feed themselves soon after they hatch.', ' ');

Eyes small, compressed by the temporal & snot muscles, which are developed for shovelling through leaf mold and decaying vegetation in order to sniff out insects. Dentition is diagnostic for the family. Nervous, high-strung: respiration rate 850/min. and heart rate of 800 beats/min, increasing to 1200 beats/min. when alarmed. Although basically nocturnal, active almost continuously to search for sufficient food to maintain high body temperature and rapid metabolic rate. Diet is primarily insects, though will eat any small creature. Smallest shrews can starve to death in 8-12 hours, and eat as much as 3 times their body weight a day; largest shrews may eat their own weight a day. Most breed at least twice a year; litter size 2-10; gestation 16-35 days. Newborn small, pink, with translucent skin revealing internal organs in some species; they nurse for 17-18 days, reach adult size in 40-50 days. Two subfamilies: ''Soricinae'' with pigmented teeth, and ''Crocidurinae'' with white teeth.
