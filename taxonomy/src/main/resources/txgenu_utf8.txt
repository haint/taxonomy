[B] /--/ [Cymbidium] /--/ [ ] /--/ [ ] /--/ [Some 50 species, most seldom appear in collections; Vietnam: 15 species. Epiphytic. Medium to large, with fairly well-developed pseudobulbs generally ovoid in shape, very close together, sometimes absent. Two major groups: those from warm zones and temperate-cold zones. Leaves often long, straight, narow, pointed, coriaceous but flexible, sheathing pseudobulb, may fall off during autumn, leaving only the surrounding basal sheath portion. Inflorescence basal, fairly long, erect, curved or pendulous, never branched. Flowers variable in size and color, long-lasting, firm, sometimes highly scented. Sepals nearly same length. Petals like sepal, or smaller. 'Cymbidium' hybrids freely available and popular. Large number of hybrids, designed to produce bigger flowers, extend range of colors, improve the shape and arrangement on the stem, have lost the typical form and colors, and instead leaves and flower have acquired a fairly uniform shape and size. All flower once a year.<br><br>Origin: China, India, Japan, SE Asia.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Eucalyptus] /--/ [Eucalyptus] /--/ [ ] /--/ [Over 500 species. Aromatic, evergreen, generally tall trees; most have resin or gum; a few are shrubs.

Some 20 species, but almost without exception the plants cultivated today are hybrids. Because of interbreeding, the National Dahlia Society of Britain has divided them into 10 classes and some sub-divisions. Generally: tuberous perennial; leaves lobed or pinnate, rich green except for a few bronze-foliaged forms; large, showy capitula, single or double, many petalled; petals from ovate to quill-like, colors from white, cream, yellow to pink, red and purple in single or (more often) mixed.

[B] /--/ [Ficus] /--/ [Fig] /--/ [Da / Sung] /--/ [World: 700 species; Vietnam: about 100; India: about 60. All 'Ficus' species stems and foliage contain a rubber-like, white, sticky latex. Barks usually smooth, lightish in color, somewhat wrinkled and ringed horizontally. Many epyphytic when young, as growing eventually strangle hosts and become self-standing. Leaves probably best way to distinguish between species; except for 'F. hispida', alternate. Inflorescence of hypanthodium form: a flask-shaped fleshy receptable with a narrow canal and a terminal pore at one end. Pore surrounded by a few scales; canal lined by downwardly pointed hairs. Receptacle bears inside male flowers towards pore and female flowers towards base. Sterile flowers occur in between 2 groups. Pollination done by small wasps, which enter receptable through a small hole at tip to lay eggs inside. The wasp itself lives most of its life within the tree. Fruit in form of a "syconium", a hollow compound fruit with a small spore protected by scales; vary in size, color & shape but rather similar looking, often pear-shaped. All give good fodder; figs eaten by birds, wild animals. Wood of low quality, for temporary appliances only. Distribution: up to 2000m. As indoor ornament, tolerant to dry, hot air.] /--/ 
[B] /--/ [Albizia] /--/ [ ] /--/ [ ] /--/ [Tropical or sub-tropical trees. Not easy to tell one species from another, except for 'A. chinensis': prominent leafy appendages at base of compound leaf. Keys for diagnostic: numbers & sizes of pinnae & pinnules, position of mid-rib of pinnules, color of flowers. Leaves often bi-pinnate. Stamens long, numerous and straight, forming tussels.

[B] /--/ [Acacia] /--/ [Acacia] /--/ [Keo] /--/ [Name derived from Greek for thorns. Consists of some 800 trees and shrubs; several extremely VARIABLE, CONFUSING.  Grows mainly in dry regions, mostly evergreen, often with spreading crown. Twigs slender, often with thorns paired from stipules or scattered. Leaves alternate, crowded, usually bipinnate; but in about 300 Australian species, the leaflets are suppressed or absent altogether: leaves become phyllodes: petioles that are flattened and perform the physiological functions of leaves. The leafstalks may be vertically arranged and bear thorns or sharp spines at their base. Flower clusters round (heads) or cylindrical (spikes) at axils. Flowers numerous, yellow or greenish-white, small, fragrant. Calyx bell-shaped, mostly 5-toothed. Petals mostly 5, more or less fused. Pistils have narrow ovary, long slender style, and dot stigma. Fruits nearly cylindrical or oblong, flat pod, not splitting open. Seeds bean-like, flattened. Distribution: widely in tropics and subtropics, greatest number in Australia and Africa. Many of the Australian species have been widely introduced elsewhere as cultivated small trees valued for their spectacular floral displays.<br><br>Several species are important economically. 'A. senegal', native to the Sudan region in Africa, yields true gum arabic, a substance used in adhesives, pharmaceuticals, inks, confections, and other products. The bark of most acacias is rich in tannin, which is used in tanning and in dyes, inks, pharmaceuticals, and other products. The babul tree ('A. arabica'), of tropical Africa and across Asia, yields both an inferior type of gum arabic and a tannin that is extensively used in India. Several Australian acacias are valuable sources of tannin, among them the golden wattle ('A. pycnantha'), the green wattle ('A. decurrens'), and the silver wattle ('A. dealbata').<br> <br>] /--/

[B] /--/ [Quercus] /--/ [Oak] /--/ [Sồi] /--/ [World: 27 species. A very important genus in temperate (except 'Q. spicata') forestry. At least some 10 major species in sub-Himalayas. Quite large trees. Characterized by alternate, simple, deciduous or evergreen leaves with lobed, toothed, or entire margins. Flowers unisexual, monoecious, in long cymes, squirrel tail-like, DROOPING. The male flowers with 5-6 sepals, 5-6 stamens, are borne in pendent yellow catkins, appearing with or after the leaves. Female flowers with same no. of sepals, ovary often 3-celled, occur on the same tree, singly or in two- to many-flowered spikes; each flower has a husk of overlapping scales that enlarges to hold the fruit, or acorn, which matures in one to two seasons. Femals . Nut 1-4. Involucre completely enclosing the nuts, spinous or tuberculous. Distr.: India 1500-2700 m; Vietnam above 400 m. Tend to grows separately, almost never form pure stands. Most suitable for fuelwood and charcoal, also for house & furniture. Recenly the species 'spicata', 'fenestrata' and 'pachyphylla' have been brought under a separate genus 'Lithocarpa'.<br><br>Oaks can be separated into three groups, sometimes considered subgenera: white oaks ('Leucobalanus') and red or black oaks ('Erythrobalanus') have the scales of the acorn cups spirally arranged; in the third group ('Cyclobalanus') the scales are fused into concentric rings. White oaks have smooth, non-bristle-tipped leaves, occasionally with glandular margins. Their acorns mature in one season, have sweet-tasting seeds, and germinate within a few days after their fall. Red or black oaks have bristle-tipped leaves, hairy-lined acorn shells, and bitter fruits, which mature at the end of the second growing season.<br><br>Two eastern Asian oaks are economically valuable: the Mongolian oak ('Q. mongolica') provides useful timber, and the Oriental oak ('Q. variabilis') is the source of a black dye as well as a popular ornamental. Popular Asian ornamentals include the blue Japanese oak ('Q. glauca'), daimyo oak ('Q. dentata'), Japanese evergreen oak ('Q. acuta'), and sawtooth oak ('Q. acutissima'). The English oak, a timber tree native to Eurasia and northern Africa, is cultivated in other areas of the world as an ornamental.<br><br>Acorns provide food for small game animals and are used to fatten swine and poultry. Red- and white-oak lumber is used in construction, flooring, furniture, millwork, cooperage, and the production of crossties, structural timbers, and mine props. <br><br>Oaks can be propagated easily from acorns and grow well in rich, moderately moist soil or dry, sandy soil. Many grow again from stump sprouts. They are hardy and long-lived but are not shade-tolerant and may be injured by leaf-eating organisms or oak wilt fungus. <br><br>The taxonomy of the genus Quercus is confusing because of the many natural hybrids.] /--/

[B] /--/ [Rosa] /--/ [Rose] /--/ [Hồng] /--/ [The rose has been grown and appreciated for its fragrance and beauty since ancient times and today is the most popular and widely cultivated garden flower in the world. Some 100 species, most native to the North Temperate Zone. Some are cultivated in their natural form or as various similar cultivars, but most of the more than 20,000 cultivars are the result of hybridization and selection from a few species. The cultivars are classed either as old roses (essentially reached the end of their horticultural development, with no new varieties having been introduced in the past 60 years, or as contemporary roses (currently being hybridized and selected for new forms). Several hundred new contemporary rose cultivars are introduced each year.<br>The classification of cultivated roses is complicated, because of the great numbers of cultivars involved and the amount of artificial hybridization that has taken place. Generally, the classes of old roses are based on selection from one or a few ancestral species or hybrids. Among the popular classes are the hybrid perpetuals, or remontant roses, which produce large, fragrant double flowers in early summer and fewer flowers in autumn, derived mainly from the hybrid species 'Rosa borboniana'. The class of polyantha roses includes many dwarf forms, with flowers produced in dense clusters, derived from the hybrid species 'Rosa rehderana'. Tea roses and China roses are old-rose classes from which the contemporary hybrid tea roses have been derived through hybridization with hybrid perpetual roses. Tea roses were derived from 'Rosa odorata'; and China roses from 'Rosa odorata' and 'Rosa chinensis'. Hybrid tea roses are less hardy but more recurrent-blooming than the old hybrid perpetuals and contain a much wider variety of color and flower form. Many other contemporary-rose classes are based on the hybrid tea roses-for example, floribunda roses were derived from crosses between hybrid tea roses and hybrid polyantha roses, the latter in turn being based on crosses between the old polyantha roses and hybrid tea roses.<br><br>] /--/

The brown booby is dark brown with a white belly and wing linings and is about 75 cm long. The Peruvian booby is valuable for its guano (excrement) deposits, used for fertilizer along the Peruvian coast.
